# What does this do?

In the current version, this program parses a simple string and gets all the ocurrences of every letter in the alphabet. With this, I'll generate a Huffman tree with the [Huffman Coding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huffman_coding) so that it can compress the files content.
