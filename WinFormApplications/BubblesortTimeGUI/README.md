# What does this do?

This program has a GUI where we generate N random arrays, with a random length L and the values are shuffled using the [Fisher-Yates Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher%E2%80%93Yates_shuffle) for shuffling the random generated array. Then, the returned value is sent to the `getTime();` function for calculating the time and ordering the array with the [Bubble sort Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort). Finally, using the `ScottPlot` NuGET package, we generate the graph to display the times.
